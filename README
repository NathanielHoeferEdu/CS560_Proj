Run Instructions:
-----------------

1. Execute the following within the directory containing the makefile to
produce the quicksort_analysis executable.

    $ make

2. To run a prompted version of the program, execute the following command.
This will produce a .txt file with a name reflecting the user input.

    $ ./quicksort_analysis

3. To compile a report of the various permutations per Part B of the
project, execute the following command. A CSV file named results.csv will
be created.

    $ ./quicksort_analysis results.csv


Notes:
------

The run times will vary between computers. I've noticed that the runtimes
reported when executed within WSU's servers are almost double of what I have
seen on my personal computer.
